## Technical Decisions

### Why MERN Stack?
- **MongoDB**: Flexible schema for financial data
- **Express.js**: Fast and minimal web framework
- **React**: Component-based UI for complex interactions
- **Node.js**: JavaScript everywhere for consistency

### Why Vite over Create React App?
- Faster development server startup
- Better build performance
- Modern ES modules support
- Smaller bundle sizes

### Why Tailwind CSS?
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Consistent design system
- Smaller CSS bundle size
- Easy responsive design

## Architecture Patterns

### Backend
- **MVC Pattern**: Controllers, Models, Routes separation
- **Middleware Pattern**: Authentication and validation
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error responses

### Frontend
- **Component Composition**: Reusable UI components
- **Context Pattern**: Global state management
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic extraction
- **Container/Presenter**: Separation of concerns

## Performance Optimizations

### Backend
- MongoDB indexing for faster queries
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- File upload size limits
- Request rate limiting

### Frontend
- Code splitting with React.lazy()
- Image optimization for receipts
- Debounced API calls
- Memoized components where needed

## Security Measures

- Password hashing with bcryptjs
- JWT token expiration
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration
- File upload restrictions
- Protected API routes

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- Add budget tracking features
- Implement recurring transactions
- Export data to CSV/Excel
- Add more chart types

### Long Term
- Mobile app development
- Bank integration APIs
- Multi-currency support
- Team/family account sharing
- AI-powered expense categorization
